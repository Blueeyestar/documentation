Installing PufferPanel
======================

The PufferPanel 1.x release series is outdated and only gets security updates at this point, as such it is strongly recommended to `install the latest version of PufferPanel instead <https://docs.pufferpanel.com/en/latest/installing.html>`_

If you absolutely need to install a 1.x release you will only receive support regarding security issues, instructions can be found `here <https://github.com/PufferPanel/documentation/blob/a2ad3f106301d31f5772e5db7e8045764f2049e4/source/installing.rst>`_
